MapInfoPhotoGPSPlotter
==================

not much to say... this tool extracts gps info from GPS tagged photos and plots them in Mapinfo.

Still in development, however this is working so give it a go.

Currently it:
plots the locations of GPS tagged photos 
orientates the symbols to show the direction the photo was taken.
Adds data to the attribute table for :
-Filename, 
-lat,long
-decimal lat, long
-File path of original photo
-direction of photo
-date and time of photo
-Local X and Y coordinates (you can pick a different coord system to plot them in)
-a simple log that may (or may not) give an indication of what it has/has not done.
